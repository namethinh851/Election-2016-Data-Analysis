Data Analysis on 2016 Election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The purpose of this project is to see if the amount of money donated to each candidate can affect directly their chances of winning the heart of American people, and hence, the Election.

The graph below illustrates the amount of donors for Hillary Clinton is much greater than Trump's.

If the hypothesis is true, Hillary Clinton should have a big lead in winning Trump and therefore win the election easily. 

However, this is not the case. If we look at the graph at below, which is located at Out[26] in the code, we can notice a different trend

As the date of the General Election gets closer, Clinton starts to lose her favorbility among the American people. The reason why this happened can be left for others to discuss, the fact of the matter is: the probability of her losing the election increases each day closer to the Election day.

In conclusion, the amount of money being donated to a candidate does not affect directly the chances of winning the Election. Though there were many factors that could contribute to one becoming the President of United States, in my opinion, the main factor still comes down how appealing a candidate was emotionally, and Trump was able to do that.
