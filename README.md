# Election-2016-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis on 2016 Elections between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The purpose of this project is to see if the amount of money donated to each candidate can affect directly their chances of winning the heart of American people, and hence, the Election.

The data shows that the amount of donations and donors for Hillary Clinton is much greater than Trump's. If the hypothesis is true, Hillary Clinton should have a big lead in winning Trump and therefore win the election easily. 

However, this is the the case. If we look at the graph at Out[26], as the general election gets closer, Clinton starts to lose her favorbility among the American people. She later loses the election to Donald Trump.

In conclusion, the amount of money being donated to a candidate does not affect directly the chances of winning the Election. Though there were many factors that could contribute to one becoming the President of United States, in my opinion, the main factor still comes down how appealing a candidate was emotionally, and Trump was able to do that.
